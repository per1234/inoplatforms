## Before Reporting an Issue

- Search [existing pull requests and issues](https://github.com/per1234/inoplatforms/issues?q=) to see if it was already reported.<br />

## Qualities of an Excellent Report

  Include the full and exact text of any relevant error or warning messages you might have encountered.
- Provide a full set of steps necessary to reproduce the issue.<br />
  Demonstration code or commands should be complete and simplified to the minimum necessary to reproduce the issue.
- Be responsive.<br />
  We may need you to provide additional information in order to investigate and resolve the issue.<br />
  Make sure your GitHub account is configured so that you will receive notifications of responses to your issue report.
- If you find a solution to your problem, please comment on your issue report with an explanation of how you were able to fix it, then close the issue.
