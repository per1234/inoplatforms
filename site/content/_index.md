A catalog of all known Arduino boards platforms.

Boards platforms (AKA "cores") add support for specific boards to the Arduino development tools. They are often installed using the Arduino IDE's "Boards Manager".

In addition to the platforms maintained by Arduino, the community has created hundreds more. The result is the availability of a diverse range of boards and microcontrollers for use by the Arduino community.

This website provides information about all of the many Arduino boards platforms.
