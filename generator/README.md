## `data` Package

In addition to the internal code that implements the **generator** command line tool, this module provides a `github.com/per1234/inoplatforms/generator/data` [**Go**](https://go.dev/) package. This package provides code to make it easy to work with the **inoplatforms** catalog data file produced by the **generator** tool.

See [**the package's documentation**](data/README.md) for more information.

## Development

Information about developing the `github.com/per1234/inoplatforms/generator` codebase is available in the [**Contributor Guide**](https://www.inoplatforms.info/contributor-guide/).
